I like learning the diff output but I found ti a bit complicated to understand.

I really need to get the hang of working with my local environment for coding.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
well it will help when I make a mistake and save over a file or delete a file by mistake. I would then be able to recover quickly and roll back any mistakes I madse,

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
It is because they are used for different things. Dropbox is more like a file server where GIT is designed for source code where files are needed to be kept together and need eachother to work properly,
