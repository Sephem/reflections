What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creats the directory structure for the GIT repository for that porject.  

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
It only contains the files you want it to contain as you may not need all the files in the working directoy to be available in your repository.

What value do you think it offers?
You can store other files in your working DIR without worrying that they will be added to GIT
